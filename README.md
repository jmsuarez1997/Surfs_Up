# Surfs_Up
A SQLite and Python analysis project
## Overview
In this analysis, SQLite temperature data is analyzed from the Hawaiian island of Oahu to determine if an ice cream and surf shop would be sustainable year-round. The data contains years of weather information for nine different weather stations around the Oahu island. The analysis looks at temperature data for the combined stations in June and December. The data will give us insight into the temperature difference year-round and if the store can be profitable in that weather.  

## Results
The June results reveal that the maximum temperature is 85 degrees and the minimum temperature is 64 degrees, perfect weather for ice cream or surfing. The shop will be profitable in the summer.

The December results reveal that the maximum temperature is 83 degrees and the minimum temperature is 56 degrees. The minimum temperatures are a little too cold for the ice cream and surfing shop. However, the average temperature for December is 71 degrees, so most of the temperatures will be good weather for ice cream and surfing.

Let's compare the variability of winter and summer temperatures using standard deviation. The June temperatures have a standard deviation of 3.25, and the December temperatures have a standard deviation of 3.25. Since June has a lower standard deviation than December, the summer months will have less variability from the mean temperature of 74.9 degrees. The winter months will see more variability from the mean temperature of 71 degrees.

## Summary
Overall, the surfing and ice cream shop will have a great chance of success on the island of Oahu based on the temperature data alone. The shop can expect to see average temperatures of 74.9 degrees in June and 71 degrees in December. A few additional queries that would be helpful for the shop owner include- analyzing the precipitation data for June and December months and identifying which station on the island has the highest temperatures and the lowest precipitation.
